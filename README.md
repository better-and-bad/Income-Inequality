# Income Inequality

## Overview
Income inequality is frequently misunderstood due to horrible reporting methodologies. 

## Key questions addressed:

How does the inclusion of taxes and transfers impact reported income inequality metrics?
What trends emerge when evaluating adjusted income data over time?
How can accurate metrics inform better economic policy?

## Data
[Income Quintiles](income_quintiles_5.xlsx) data comes from the Tax Policy Center. I came away with the same results as The Myth of American Inequality book by John Early et al.
